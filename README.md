## User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
## Deployed App
GitHub: [Random Password Generator](https://jonnikim.github.io/03RandomPWGenerator/)

## Installation
```
i. Fork the Github repository.
ii. Clone the forked repo into your local machine
iii. open index.html in browser
```

## Usage

Notable Technologies Used:
- Javascript

Password character length is prompted and saved as the possible generated password's max character length.

Possible values for the password's characters (numbers, upper/lower-case, etc.) were determined using confirms which were then saved. Then if (confirm), add those characters as possible options in the password generator.

Then using a for loop, Math.floor(), and Math.random(), I would get the index value of the possible password characters and randomly push that into the final password's value.

Then utilized DOM manipulation to post the results onto the page.
