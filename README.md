# 03RandomPWGenerator

In this week's homework, we were tasked to create a random password generator. We had to utilize what we learned in the week to create the application.

Password character length is prompted and saved as the possible generated password's max character length.

Possible values for the password's characters (numbers, upper/lower-case, etc.) were determined using confirms which were then saved. Then if (confirm), add those characters as possible options in the password generator.

Then using a for loop, Math.floor(), and Math.random(), I would get the index value of the possible password characters and randomly push that into the final password's value.

Then utilized DOM manipulation to post the results onto the page.
